How to write a paper 1010
a short course by jakob d hamilton

## 1.	Make your story
a.	We have a robotic grinding cell that takes a 3D image of a surface, and automatically plans and executes toolpaths for a grinding robot while avoiding collisions.
b.	the novelty we are trying to convey is that Randev has discovered/invented a convenient way to identify regions that need ground based on physical operator markings.
## 2.	Convince me
a.	Results need to show me (the reader) that your method works
b.	HOW? FIGURES (Images, plots, tables, etc.)
i.	What are the original surfaces? How do they compare to the scanned surfaces?
ii.	What are the identified color boundaries?
iii.	Can it handle disconnected boundaries?
iv.	How does it handle different colors?
v.	Cases of failing: limitations to the current method
vi.	Sensitivity analysis: how does the boundary identification process behave when you twist dials or change parameters?
## 3.	Write the results
a.	Write in text what the figures tell me
## 4. Write your discussion
a. What explains your results? Why did whatever happen happen?
b. What are the critical limitations?
c. If you had $1M and 6 more months, what would you do next?
## 5. Polish, Proof, Polish again, Proof again
## 6. Publish
## 7. Revise and publish again!
